# Feature Specification: Aggregator Plugin Type

**Feature Branch**: `004-aggregator-plugin-type`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "aggregator plugin type add a type of plugin that can receive a user prompt through a special aggregator tool call and then use mcp servers like context7 and serena to rank and aggreagate data to form the response for the llm prompt; providing clearer instructions to the llm without extra waste"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Context Aggregation for Improved LLM Responses (Priority: P1)

As an LLM agent, I need to gather and rank information from multiple MCP servers (like context7 and serena) in response to a user query, so that I can provide higher-quality responses with relevant, ranked information instead of wasting context on irrelevant data.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - reducing context waste and improving response quality through intelligent aggregation. Without this, the feature has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by invoking the aggregator tool with a sample user prompt and verifying it returns ranked, aggregated results from configured MCP servers. Delivers immediate value by providing curated information instead of raw data dumps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent receives a user query about a programming topic, **When** the agent calls the aggregator tool with the query, **Then** the system queries context7 for relevant documentation and returns ranked results based on relevance
2. **Given** an LLM agent needs code analysis, **When** the agent calls the aggregator tool with a code-related query, **Then** the system queries serena for semantic analysis and returns prioritized results
3. **Given** multiple MCP servers can answer a query, **When** the aggregator processes the query, **Then** results from all relevant servers are combined and ranked by relevance before being returned
4. **Given** an aggregator query with specific context limits, **When** processing results, **Then** only the top-ranked results within the limit are included in the response

### User Story 2 - Configurable Server Selection (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I need to configure which MCP servers the aggregator uses for different query types, so that I can optimize aggregation behavior for my specific use case and available servers.

**Why this priority**: Enables customization and optimization but the feature works with default "all servers" behavior for P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring aggregator settings to use specific servers (e.g., only context7 for documentation queries) and verifying only those servers are queried.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** aggregator configuration specifies context7 for documentation queries, **When** a documentation query is processed, **Then** only context7 is queried (not serena or other servers)
2. **Given** no specific configuration exists for a query type, **When** aggregator processes the query, **Then** all available MCP servers are queried as fallback
3. **Given** a server is disabled in configuration, **When** aggregator processes any query, **Then** that server is never queried regardless of query type

### User Story 3 - Response Quality Metrics (Priority: P3)

As an LLM agent, I want to see quality metrics for aggregated results (relevance scores, source diversity, freshness), so that I can make informed decisions about which information to use in my response.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature that enhances trust and transparency but not critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by inspecting aggregator tool responses for metadata fields containing quality metrics and verifying they reflect actual result characteristics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** aggregated results from multiple servers, **When** results are returned, **Then** each result includes a relevance score indicating how well it matches the query
2. **Given** results from different MCP servers, **When** aggregation completes, **Then** response includes server diversity metric showing how many different sources contributed
3. **Given** cached vs fresh results, **When** aggregator returns data, **Then** each result includes timestamp indicating data freshness

### Edge Cases

- What happens when all configured MCP servers are unavailable or fail to respond?
- How does the system handle queries that exceed token/context limits even after aggregation?
- What happens when MCP servers return conflicting or contradictory information?
- How does aggregation handle servers with different response times (fast vs slow)?
- What happens when a server returns an error during aggregation?
- How are duplicate results from multiple servers de-duplicated?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an aggregator tool that LLM agents can call with a user prompt/query
- **FR-002**: Aggregator MUST query specified MCP servers (context7, serena, and others) with the provided prompt
- **FR-003**: Aggregator MUST rank results from each server based on relevance to the query
- **FR-004**: Aggregator MUST combine results from multiple servers into a single, prioritized response
- **FR-005**: Aggregator MUST limit total response size to prevent context waste while preserving highest-value information
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle server failures gracefully without blocking aggregation from working servers
- **FR-007**: Aggregator MUST de-duplicate identical or highly similar results from different servers
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow configuration of which MCP servers participate in aggregation
- **FR-009**: Aggregator MUST complete queries within reasonable time limits to avoid blocking LLM responses
- **FR-010**: Results MUST include source attribution showing which MCP server provided each piece of information

### Key Entities

- **Aggregator Query**: User prompt/question submitted to the aggregator tool for processing
- **Server Result**: Individual response from a single MCP server (context7, serena, etc.)
- **Aggregated Response**: Combined, ranked, and de-duplicated results from all queried servers
- **Ranking Metadata**: Relevance scores, source information, and quality metrics for each result
- **Server Configuration**: Settings defining which MCP servers to query for different query types

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: LLM agents can invoke aggregator tool and receive ranked results from multiple MCP servers in a single call
- **SC-002**: Aggregated responses are 40-60% smaller than raw combined results from all servers while preserving top-quality information
- **SC-003**: Query processing completes within 5 seconds for 90% of requests
- **SC-004**: Results include clear source attribution showing which information came from which server
- **SC-005**: LLM agents report improved response quality due to pre-ranked, relevant information (qualitative improvement)
- **SC-006**: System gracefully handles server failures with degraded functionality (returns results from working servers)

## Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: MCP servers like context7 and serena expose tools/APIs that can be called with queries
- **Assumption 2**: Ranking algorithms can determine relevance without requiring LLM/AI processing (rule-based or heuristic ranking)
- **Assumption 3**: Users (LLM agents) prefer quality over quantity - willing to trade completeness for relevance
- **Assumption 4**: Default behavior queries all available MCP servers unless explicitly configured otherwise
- **Assumption 5**: Aggregation happens synchronously within tool call - no background processing or caching required for MVP
- **Assumption 6**: Results from different servers use compatible formats that can be normalized and compared

## Dependencies

- Existing MCP server infrastructure (context7, serena, and any other configured servers)
- MCP proxy must support tool invocation and server communication
- Servers must be running and accessible when aggregator is called

## Out of Scope

- Custom AI/ML-based ranking models (using rule-based ranking for MVP)
- Real-time streaming of results (batch aggregation only)
- User feedback loop to improve ranking over time (future enhancement)
- Caching of aggregated results (future performance optimization)
- Support for non-text query types (images, audio queries)
- Customizable ranking algorithms per user/agent

## Known Limitations

- Aggregation quality depends on the quality and availability of configured MCP servers
- Ranking is heuristic-based (keyword matching, result length, server reputation) rather than semantic
- Processing multiple servers may take 3-5 seconds depending on server response times
- Maximum aggregated response size is fixed (not dynamically adjusted based on query complexity)
