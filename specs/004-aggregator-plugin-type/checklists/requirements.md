# Specification Quality Checklist: Aggregator Plugin Type

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is:
- Technology-agnostic (no mention of Rust, specific libraries, or implementation patterns)
- Focused on LLM agent and admin user needs (context reduction, quality improvement, configurability)
- Measurable with clear success criteria (40-60% size reduction, 5-second processing time, quality improvement)
- Complete with all functional requirements testable and unambiguous
- Ready for planning phase

The spec provides clear value proposition: reducing context waste while improving information quality through intelligent aggregation across multiple MCP servers.

## Notes

- Spec assumes heuristic-based ranking for MVP (documented in Assumptions)
- Out of scope section clearly defines future enhancements vs MVP
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios (server unavailability, conflicts, timeouts)
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
