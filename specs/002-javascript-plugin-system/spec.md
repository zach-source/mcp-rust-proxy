# Feature Specification: JavaScript Plugin System for MCP Proxy

**Feature Branch**: `002-javascript-plugin-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "javascript plugin system add a javascript plugin system to run custom middleware for different mcp servers and to extend the support for security or other; an example implementation would be a curation tool to help reduce context usage from docs tools"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: Who is the primary persona for configuring which plugins run on which MCP servers? → A: End user of the MCP proxy (self-configuration)
- Q: What data format should plugins use for input/output? → A: JSON or MessagePack (binary efficiency option)
- Q: When a plugin fails or throws an error, what should happen to the request? → A: Fail the entire request (strict safety)
- Q: How do plugins access AI capabilities? → A: Plugins bring their own SDK/credentials
- Q: What type of isolation between plugins is needed? → A: Separate Node.js processes per plugin

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Content Curation for Documentation Tools (Priority: P1)

An end user of the MCP proxy working with documentation servers (like Context7) receives verbose outputs that exceed token limits. They want to configure and enable a curation plugin to automatically reduce these outputs to only relevant information, managing context usage without manual filtering.

**Why this priority**: Directly addresses the primary use case mentioned in the feature description. Solves an immediate pain point of context/token management with documentation tools.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a JavaScript plugin for a documentation server, making a query, and verifying the output is curated to contain only relevant information within specified token limits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a documentation tool returns 50KB of output, **When** the curation plugin processes it with a 1200 token limit, **Then** the output is reduced to essential information fitting within the limit
2. **Given** a user query about a specific API, **When** the curation plugin processes the documentation, **Then** boilerplate, banners, and duplicate content are removed while preserving code examples
3. **Given** the curated output, **When** compared to the original, **Then** no facts are invented and all preserved information is accurate

### User Story 2 - Security Middleware for Sensitive Operations (Priority: P2)

An end user wants to configure security plugins that add checks before certain MCP server operations execute, such as validating requests, sanitizing inputs, or enforcing access controls based on custom business rules.

**Why this priority**: Security is critical but can be implemented after basic plugin infrastructure. Enables extension beyond just content processing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a security plugin that blocks specific operations, attempting those operations, and verifying they are properly intercepted and blocked/allowed based on rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a security plugin with access rules, **When** a restricted operation is attempted, **Then** the plugin blocks it and returns an appropriate error
2. **Given** an input validation plugin, **When** malformed data is sent to an MCP server, **Then** the plugin sanitizes or rejects it before forwarding
3. **Given** a logging plugin, **When** sensitive operations occur, **Then** audit events are recorded with relevant context

---

### User Story 3 - Custom Response Transformation (Priority: P3)

An end user wants to configure transformation plugins that modify MCP server responses to match their expected format, such as converting data structures, adding metadata, or enriching responses with additional context.

**Why this priority**: Useful for integration scenarios but less critical than curation and security. Can be deferred to later iterations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a transformation plugin, making requests to MCP servers, and verifying responses are transformed to the expected format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a filesystem server response, **When** the transformation plugin processes it, **Then** file paths are converted to a custom format
2. **Given** a git server response, **When** enrichment is enabled, **Then** commit metadata is augmented with additional project-specific information
3. **Given** multiple plugins chained together, **When** a request is processed, **Then** each plugin's transformation is applied in sequence

---

### Edge Cases

- **Plugin failure/error**: The entire request MUST fail with an error returned to the client (strict safety model). The error response MUST include the plugin name and failure reason for debugging.
- **Timeout exceeded**: Treated as a plugin failure; the request MUST fail with a timeout error indicating which plugin exceeded its time limit.
- **Malformed output**: Treated as a plugin failure; the request MUST fail with a schema validation error.
- **Conflicting transformations**: Not applicable - plugins execute sequentially in defined order; each plugin processes the output of the previous one.
- **Missing external dependencies**: Treated as a plugin failure during initialization; affected requests MUST fail with a dependency error. Each plugin process manages its own dependencies independently.
- **Performance degradation**: Plugins are subject to timeout limits; if execution time approaches limits, monitoring/logging will capture metrics but request proceeds unless timeout is exceeded.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support loading JavaScript plugins from a configurable directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute plugins as middleware that can intercept and modify requests to MCP servers
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute plugins as middleware that can intercept and modify responses from MCP servers
- **FR-004**: Plugins MUST receive structured input in JSON or MessagePack format including user query, tool name, and raw content
- **FR-005**: Plugins MUST return structured output in JSON or MessagePack format that the proxy can process (e.g., modified content or control signals)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support plugin configuration per MCP server (e.g., curation plugin only for documentation servers)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle plugin failures by failing the request with a detailed error (plugin name, failure reason) without crashing the proxy
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide timeout mechanisms for plugin execution to prevent hanging
- **FR-009**: Plugins MAY import and use their own AI SDKs and credentials (e.g., Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI) for processing logic
- **FR-010**: System MUST support chaining multiple plugins in a defined order
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow plugins to signal whether to continue processing or halt the request
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate plugin output schemas before using them
- **FR-013**: System MUST log plugin execution including success, failures, and performance metrics
- **FR-014**: Plugins MUST run in separate Node.js processes to prevent interference between plugins
- **FR-015**: System MUST support both request-phase and response-phase plugins
- **FR-016**: Configuration MUST specify which plugins apply to which MCP servers or tool types

### Key Entities

- **Plugin**: A JavaScript module that runs in its own Node.js process and processes MCP requests or responses, with defined input/output schemas
- **Plugin Configuration**: Settings that specify which plugins to load, their execution order, timeout limits, process isolation settings, and server assignments
- **Plugin Input**: Structured data in JSON or MessagePack format passed to plugins including `userQuery`, `toolName`, `rawContent`, `maxTokens`, and metadata
- **Plugin Output**: Structured data in JSON or MessagePack format returned by plugins including modified `text`, control signals (`continue`, `halt`), and optional metadata
- **Plugin Chain**: An ordered sequence of plugins that process a request or response sequentially

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Documentation tool outputs are reduced by 60-80% while preserving all relevant information
- **SC-002**: Plugin execution adds less than 500ms latency to 95% of requests
- **SC-003**: System continues operating normally (no crashes) even when 100% of plugins fail, returning appropriate errors to clients
- **SC-004**: End users can configure and enable new plugins without restarting the proxy
- **SC-005**: 100% of plugin errors are caught, logged with context, and result in failed requests (no silent failures)
- **SC-006**: Users can chain up to 5 plugins per server without noticeable performance degradation

## Assumptions

- JavaScript runtime (Node.js) is available in the execution environment
- Plugins follow a standard input/output contract defined by the system
- Plugins manage their own external dependencies and AI SDK credentials (not provided by proxy)
- Plugin code is trusted (no sandboxing required for MVP)
- Plugins are stateless and don't require persistent storage
- Standard timeout for plugin execution is 30 seconds unless configured otherwise
- Plugin configuration changes require proxy restart for MVP (hot-reloading can be added later)

## Scope

### In Scope

- JavaScript plugin loading and execution infrastructure with process-based isolation
- Plugin input/output schema definitions (JSON and MessagePack support)
- Configuration format for assigning plugins to MCP servers
- Error handling and timeout mechanisms for plugin execution
- Inter-process communication between proxy and plugin processes
- Request-phase and response-phase plugin hooks
- Example curation plugin implementation
- Plugin execution logging and metrics

### Out of Scope

- Security sandboxing beyond process isolation (assumes trusted plugins)
- Plugin marketplace or distribution system
- Hot-reloading of plugins without restart
- Plugin version management
- Plugins written in languages other than JavaScript
- Built-in plugin development SDK (beyond documentation)
- Visual plugin configuration UI
