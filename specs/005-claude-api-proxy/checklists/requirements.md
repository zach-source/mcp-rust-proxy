# Specification Quality Checklist: Claude API Proxy for Context Tracing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Iteration 1**: ✅ PASSED (Initial spec)
**Iteration 2**: ✅ PASSED (Enhanced with transparent proxy clarifications)

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification avoids technology-specific details (no mention of specific frameworks, languages, or databases)
- ✅ Focus is on user value: context visibility, audit trails, feedback mechanisms, cost optimization
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders with clear business benefits
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- ✅ NEW: Overview section explicitly clarifies transparent proxy architecture

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ Requirements are testable and now organized into logical categories (Transparent Proxy, Capture, Attribution, Feedback, Operational)
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (5 seconds, 100% capture rate, <100ms latency, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details - focus on outcomes
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given/When/Then format for all 4 user stories
- ✅ Edge cases cover critical scenarios including TLS/SSL, proxy crashes, concurrent connections
- ✅ Scope clearly defines what's included and explicitly lists what's out of scope
- ✅ Dependencies section identifies HTTPS proxy knowledge, TLS/SSL handling, and system configuration
- ✅ Assumptions document transparent proxy operation via environment variables/system settings
- ✅ NEW: FR-001 through FR-006 explicitly define transparent proxy behavior
- ✅ NEW: Constraints clarify no modification of requests/responses, authentication pass-through

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-024) maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios progress logically from P1 (core visibility) to P3 (optimization)
- ✅ Each priority level can function independently as an MVP
- ✅ Success criteria provide clear measurable outcomes for the feature
- ✅ No technology leakage - specification maintains abstraction throughout
- ✅ NEW: Transparent proxy architecture is clearly defined without implementation details

## Architectural Clarity Enhancements (Iteration 2)

The specification now explicitly defines:

1. **Transparent HTTPS Proxy**: Overview section establishes that this is a pass-through proxy that captures traffic without modification
2. **Authentication Pass-Through**: FR-002 and constraints clarify that Claude CLI auth (API keys, tokens) passes through unchanged
3. **Capture-and-Forward Pattern**: FR-007 through FR-012 define the capture workflow before/after forwarding to actual Claude API
4. **TLS/SSL Handling**: Dependencies and edge cases address HTTPS encryption, certificate handling
5. **Fail-Open Behavior**: FR-021 ensures proxy failures don't break Claude Code functionality
6. **System Integration**: Assumptions clarify proxy configuration via environment variables or system settings

## Notes

All checklist items passed on both iterations. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Well-structured user stories with clear priorities and independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements (now 24 total) covering all aspects of transparent proxying
- Explicit architectural clarity: HTTPS proxy, auth pass-through, capture-and-forward
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Clear scope boundaries preventing feature creep
- Good balance of assumptions and constraints
- Strong security considerations (TLS, sensitive data protection, fail-open)

**Critical Architectural Points**:
- TRUE transparent proxy: no request/response modification
- Claude CLI authentication preserved exactly as-is
- HTTPS traffic captured but security maintained
- Operates at network layer (system proxy or environment variables)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Consider running `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholders need to validate TLS/SSL certificate handling approach or system proxy configuration method
