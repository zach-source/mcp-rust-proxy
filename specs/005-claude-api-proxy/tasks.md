# Tasks: Claude API Proxy for Context Tracing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-claude-api-proxy/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single project: `src/` at repository root
- Following existing MCP Rust Proxy structure

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Foundational phase is BLOCKING** - must complete before user stories start
- User stories can run in parallel once Foundation is ready
- MVP is User Story 1 only - provides core value
- Tests are throughout development, not a separate phase

**Total Tasks**: 50
- Setup: 3 tasks
- Foundational: 6 tasks (BLOCKING)
- User Story 1 (P1 - MVP): 10 tasks
- User Story 2 (P1): 5 tasks
- User Story 3 (P2): 6 tasks
- User Story 4 (P3): 5 tasks
- Integration: 3 tasks
- Retention: 2 tasks
- Testing: 5 tasks
- Polish: 5 tasks

**MVP Scope**: T001-T009 (Setup + Foundational) + T010-T019 (US1) + T036-T038 (Integration) = 22 tasks for minimal viable product
