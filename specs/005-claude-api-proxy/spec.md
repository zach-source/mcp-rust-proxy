# Feature Specification: Claude API Proxy for Context Tracing

**Feature Branch**: `005-claude-api-proxy`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "claude api proxy consider approaches to proxy the actual claude api (or alternatives) so we can capture, audit, and trace our entire context that is being sent to the backend apis. the intention is for us to try to clearly see where data from different sources (mcp, skills) is coming from and help the feedback mechanism to improve our claude code outputs"

## Overview

This feature provides a transparent HTTPS proxy that sits between Claude Code CLI and the Claude API. The proxy intercepts all HTTPS traffic, captures the complete request and response for analysis, then forwards the request to the actual Claude API endpoint unchanged. Claude CLI's existing authentication (API keys, tokens) passes through the proxy transparently, requiring no changes to how users authenticate or use Claude Code.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Context Source Visibility (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Claude Code, I need to understand what context is being sent to the Claude API so that I can identify which MCP servers, skills, or other sources are contributing to each API request.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing transparency into context composition. Without this, developers cannot understand or improve their Claude Code configurations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a Claude API request through the proxy and inspecting the captured request details to verify all context sources are identified and labeled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am using Claude Code with multiple MCP servers enabled, **When** Claude makes an API request, **Then** I can view a breakdown showing which portions of the request context came from each MCP server
2. **Given** context is being sent from both MCP servers and skills, **When** I inspect a captured request, **Then** I can see clear labels identifying "MCP: context7", "MCP: serena", "Skill: vectorize", etc.
3. **Given** a request includes user messages and system prompts, **When** I view the captured data, **Then** I can distinguish between user-provided content and framework-injected content

### User Story 2 - Request/Response Audit Trail (Priority: P1)

As a developer debugging Claude Code behavior, I need to review the complete request and response history so that I can understand what was sent to Claude and what was received back.

**Why this priority**: Essential for debugging and understanding Claude's responses. Forms the foundation for the feedback mechanism.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing a series of Claude Code operations and verifying that all API requests and responses are captured with timestamps and correlation IDs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code makes multiple API requests during a session, **When** I view the audit trail, **Then** I see each request with its full payload, response, timestamp, and unique identifier
2. **Given** an API request fails or returns an error, **When** I check the audit trail, **Then** I see the error details, request that caused it, and timing information
3. **Given** a long-running conversation, **When** I search the audit trail, **Then** I can filter by time range, request type, or context source

---

### User Story 3 - Context Quality Feedback Integration (Priority: P2)

As a Claude Code user who has reviewed captured requests, I need to provide feedback on context quality so that the system can learn which context sources produce better outcomes.

**Why this priority**: Enables the feedback loop for continuous improvement. Builds on P1 stories by adding actionable insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting quality ratings for captured requests and verifying that feedback is associated with the correct context sources and influences future context selection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have reviewed a captured API request and response, **When** I rate the response quality, **Then** my rating is associated with all context sources that contributed to that request
2. **Given** multiple requests have used context from a specific MCP server, **When** I view quality metrics, **Then** I see aggregate ratings showing which context sources consistently produce better results
3. **Given** certain context sources have low quality ratings, **When** the system selects context for new requests, **Then** it can deprioritize low-quality sources (assuming configuration allows)

---

### User Story 4 - Context Size and Cost Analysis (Priority: P3)

As a developer managing Claude API costs, I need to understand how much context each source contributes to my API requests so that I can optimize my configuration for cost and performance.

**Why this priority**: Provides operational insights but is not required for basic functionality. Helps users optimize their setups.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining context size metrics and verifying accurate token counts and cost estimates for each context source.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a captured API request, **When** I view its breakdown, **Then** I see token counts for each context source (e.g., "MCP: context7 - 1,500 tokens", "Skills - 800 tokens")
2. **Given** multiple requests over time, **When** I view cost analysis, **Then** I see which context sources consume the most tokens and contribute to API costs
3. **Given** I want to reduce costs, **When** I review context metrics, **Then** I can identify specific MCP servers or skills that could be disabled or optimized

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Claude API endpoint changes or becomes unavailable?
- How does the proxy handle TLS/SSL certificate validation and trust?
- What happens if the proxy process crashes while requests are in flight?
- How does the system handle extremely large context payloads that exceed size limits?
- What if a user disables the proxy mid-session - does existing data remain accessible?
- How are API keys and sensitive data protected in captured requests?
- What happens when multiple concurrent HTTPS connections are active?
- How long is captured data retained, and what happens when storage fills up?
- What if context sources (MCP servers) fail to provide data during a request?
- How does the proxy distinguish between Claude API traffic and other HTTPS traffic?
- What happens if Claude CLI bypasses the proxy (direct connection)?

## Assumptions

- Claude Code uses a single API endpoint or small set of HTTPS endpoints that can be identified and intercepted (e.g., api.anthropic.com)
- Claude CLI authentication uses standard HTTP headers (Authorization, API keys) that can be forwarded without modification
- The proxy can be configured as an HTTPS proxy via environment variables or system proxy settings
- Context from different sources (MCP servers, skills) can be programmatically identified and labeled at the point of composition by Claude Code
- Users have sufficient storage for captured request data based on their usage patterns
- API request payloads follow a consistent structure (JSON) that allows parsing and source attribution
- Users understand basic concepts of API requests, tokens, and context windows
- The proxy operates in the same environment/network as Claude Code (e.g., local machine, same container)
- TLS/SSL certificates can be handled appropriately (either via system trust store or proxy certificate generation)
- Default data retention period is 30 days unless configured otherwise
- Quality feedback uses a numeric scale (e.g., 1-5 or 1-10) with optional text comments
- Users have permission to inspect and store their own API request data for analysis
- Proxy adds minimal latency (<100ms) and doesn't significantly impact user experience
