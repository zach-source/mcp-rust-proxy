# Feature Specification: AI Context Provenance & Evolution Framework

**Feature Branch**: `001-context-tracing-framework`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "context tracing framework review the context tracing framework doc and build a spec from it"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Trace Response Origins (Priority: P1)

As a developer debugging AI responses, I need to understand which sources influenced a specific answer so that I can identify when the AI is using outdated or incorrect information.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other provenance tracking features. Without the ability to trace response origins, the framework provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating an AI response and viewing its lineage manifest showing all contributing context units with their weights, delivering immediate transparency into response origins.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AI response has been generated, **When** I request its trace information, **Then** I see a lineage manifest showing all context units that contributed to the response
2. **Given** multiple context sources were used (memory, tools, web), **When** I view the trace, **Then** each source is identified with its type, contribution weight, and timestamp
3. **Given** a response trace is displayed, **When** I examine the context tree, **Then** I can see hierarchical relationships between context units

### User Story 2 - Query Context Impact (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I need to identify all responses influenced by specific context sources so that I can assess the impact of outdated or incorrect information.

**Why this priority**: Once we can trace individual responses, the next critical need is understanding the broader impact of context quality issues across many responses.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by storing context lineage data and querying for all responses using a specific context unit, delivering actionable insights about context source impact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** context lineage data has been stored, **When** I query for responses using a specific memory embedding, **Then** I see all responses influenced by that memory with their contribution scores
2. **Given** outdated documentation exists in the system, **When** I search for responses derived from that documentation, **Then** I can identify which responses may need regeneration
3. **Given** a context unit has been flagged as problematic, **When** I view its impact report, **Then** I see metrics on how many responses were affected and the severity of influence

---

### User Story 3 - Track Context Evolution (Priority: P3)

As a knowledge manager, I need to understand how concepts and information evolve over time so that I can maintain the quality and accuracy of the AI's knowledge base.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for long-term system improvement, context evolution tracking is not critical for basic provenance functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by storing versioned context units and querying for historical changes to specific concepts, delivering insights into knowledge evolution patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a concept has been updated multiple times, **When** I request its evolution history, **Then** I see a timeline of how the concept's representation changed over time
2. **Given** multiple versions of a context unit exist, **When** I compare versions, **Then** I can see semantic differences and their timestamps
3. **Given** context feedback has been collected, **When** I view evolution data, **Then** I can correlate changes with feedback scores

---

### User Story 4 - Improve Context Quality Through Feedback (Priority: P4)

As a model operator, I need to provide feedback on response quality that propagates to contributing context units so that the system continuously improves its knowledge base.

**Why this priority**: Feedback loops enable continuous improvement but depend on having the foundational tracing and storage capabilities in place first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rating responses and verifying that feedback scores are applied to the contributing context units, delivering measurable quality improvements over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I rate a response as helpful or unhelpful, **When** the feedback is processed, **Then** all contributing context units have their weights adjusted accordingly
2. **Given** a context unit consistently contributes to poor responses, **When** its aggregate score falls below a threshold, **Then** the system flags it for review or deprecation
3. **Given** feedback has been applied over time, **When** I review context quality metrics, **Then** I see measurable improvements in average response ratings

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a response uses no retrievable context (pure model knowledge)?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies in context derivation chains?
- What happens when a context unit is deleted but historical responses still reference it?
- How are contribution weights calculated when multiple overlapping context sources provide similar information?
- What happens when the context graph becomes too large to query efficiently?
- How does the system handle context units that are updated while responses are being generated?

- **Response**: An AI-generated output, identified by UUID, containing references to all contributing context units, agent/model information, and timestamp
- **Lineage Manifest**: A structured record linking a response to its contributing context units with weights and provenance tree showing derivation relationships
- **Context Graph**: A network structure showing relationships between context units, responses, and their evolution over time with edges representing usage, derivation, and update relationships
