## Production Readiness

### ✅ Ready For

- Development/testing environments
- MVP demonstrations
- Internal company use
- Proof of concept deployments
- Single-user scenarios

### ⚠️ Conditional For

- Production (add authentication first)
- Public deployment (security hardening)
- Team collaboration (add rate limiting)

### ❌ Not Yet For

- Enterprise/multi-tenant (needs full security)
- Public API (requires auth + rate limiting)
- High-scale production (needs load testing)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Specification-driven development** - Clear tasks led to complete implementation
2. **Test-driven approach** - Tests caught issues early
3. **Incremental commits** - Easy to track progress
4. **Real Claude testing** - Validated actual use case
5. **Comprehensive docs** - Users have clear guidance

### Challenges Overcome

1. **RUSTFLAGS linker issues** - Workaround with unset/empty
2. **Yew UI build hangs** - Disabled auto-build in release
3. **Stdio mode integration** - Added dedicated mode
4. **Permission handling** - Used --dangerously-skip-permissions for tests
5. **Type system complexity** - RwLock wrapping for interior mutability

### Areas for Future Improvement

1. **Authentication system** - Critical for production
2. **Configuration tunability** - Extract hardcoded values
3. **Performance optimization** - Cache eviction, spawn_blocking
4. **Complete placeholder features** - Top contexts, session storage
5. **Enhanced metadata** - Richer context information
