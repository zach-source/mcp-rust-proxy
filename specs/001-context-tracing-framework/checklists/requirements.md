# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Context Provenance & Evolution Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains proper abstraction level:
- No specific technologies mentioned (databases, frameworks, languages)
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- User-centric language throughout
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Requirements are comprehensive and clear:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are testable (can verify with specific inputs/outputs)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (time thresholds, percentages, counts)
- Acceptance scenarios use standard Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover key boundary conditions
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- Assumptions and Dependencies sections properly populated

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification is implementation-ready:
- Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios
- User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- Success criteria map to user stories and requirements
- No technology-specific details in specification
- Clear separation between what the system must do vs how it will do it

## Notes

- Specification successfully completed without requiring user clarifications
- All quality gates passed on first iteration
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan` (required next step)
- Consider clarification phase if stakeholders want to refine edge case handling or adjust success criteria thresholds
