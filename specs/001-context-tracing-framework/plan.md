# Implementation Plan: AI Context Provenance & Evolution Framework

**Branch**: `001-context-tracing-framework` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-context-tracing-framework/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a context tracing framework that tracks provenance and evolution of AI responses within the MCP Rust Proxy. The system will capture context units (sources of information), generate lineage manifests showing how each response was influenced, and enable querying to understand context impact and quality over time. This provides transparency, auditability, and continuous improvement of the AI knowledge base.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust stable (edition 2021, as specified in Cargo.toml)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- tokio (async runtime)
- serde/serde_json (serialization)
- warp (web API)
- dashmap (concurrent storage)
- uuid (unique identifiers)
- chrono (timestamps)
- rusqlite (SQLite embedded database with JSON1 extension)

**Storage**: Hybrid DashMap + SQLite (resolved in Phase 0 research - see research.md)

**Testing**: cargo test (existing test framework in project)

**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS server (existing proxy deployment)

**Project Type**: Single project (extending existing MCP proxy codebase)

**Performance Goals**:
- Trace retrieval: < 2 seconds
- Context queries: < 5 seconds for 100K responses
- Lineage manifest generation: < 100ms overhead per response
- Concurrent access: 50 users without corruption

**Constraints**:
- < 5KB storage per lineage manifest
- Zero data corruption during concurrent access
- 90-day default retention with configurable policy
- Must not significantly degrade existing proxy performance

**Scale/Scope**:
- Support 100K+ stored responses
- Handle 20+ context units per response
- Track evolution over 90+ days
- Support 50 concurrent users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution File Status**: Template constitution found - no specific project constitution defined yet.

Since no project-specific constitution exists, applying general software engineering principles:

### Initial Check (Pre-Research)

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Simplicity** | ✅ PASS | Feature starts with minimal viable implementation (P1 user story only) |
| **Testability** | ✅ PASS | Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios; cargo test framework exists |
| **Incremental Development** | ✅ PASS | 4 prioritized user stories allow phased delivery |
| **No Over-Engineering** | ⚠️ NEEDS RESEARCH | Storage backend choice (graph vs relational vs embedded) needs investigation |
| **Integration** | ✅ PASS | Extends existing MCP proxy codebase rather than separate system |

### Post-Design Check (After Phase 1)

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Simplicity** | ✅ PASS | Hybrid DashMap + SQLite leverages existing patterns; no complex graph DB needed |
| **Testability** | ✅ PASS | Data model has clear validation rules; API contracts define testable endpoints |
| **Incremental Development** | ✅ PASS | Design supports phased rollout: P1 (basic tracking) → P2 (queries) → P3 (evolution) → P4 (feedback) |
| **No Over-Engineering** | ✅ PASS | Chose embedded SQLite over PostgreSQL/graph DB; composite weight calculation over ML models |
| **Integration** | ✅ PASS | New `src/context/` module follows existing code structure; extends web API naturally |

**All Constitution Gates Passed** ✅

**Structure Decision**: Extending the existing single-project structure with a new `context` module. This follows the project's modular design pattern (config/, protocol/, transport/, web/) and allows incremental integration with existing proxy functionality.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

*No complexity violations - all gates passed.*

**Storage Decision**: After Phase 0 research, selected Hybrid DashMap + SQLite approach which aligns with simplicity principle while meeting performance requirements. This avoids over-engineering with graph databases while still supporting efficient bidirectional queries via SQLite recursive CTEs and in-memory caching.
