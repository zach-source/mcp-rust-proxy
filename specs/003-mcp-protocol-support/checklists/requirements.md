# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Protocol Version Negotiation and Conversion Layer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is:
- Free of implementation details (no mention of Rust, specific libraries, or code structure)
- Focused on solving the real production issue (servers crashing, missing tools)
- Technology-agnostic with measurable success criteria (tool counts, connection success rates, error reduction)
- Complete with no clarification markers needed (all requirements are specific and testable)
- Ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification directly addresses the root cause: protocol version mismatches and initialization sequence errors
- Success criteria include quantifiable metrics (42 → 76-86 tools, 44% → 100% success rate, zero crashes)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
